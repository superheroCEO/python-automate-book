1) operators = *, -, /, +
values = 'hello'(string), -88.8 (float), 5 (integer)
2) spam = variable, 'spam' = string 
3) string, float, integer
4) expression made up of operators & values; all expressions result in a single value
5) an assignment has a variable and assigns a value to it. ie Taylor = 26 (26 is value, Taylor is the variable)
6) 21
7) 'spamspamspam'; 'spamspamspam'
8) variables cannot be a number
9) int, float, str
10) error bc of 99, cannot add integers & string; fix by converting 99; int(99)--> str(int(99))
